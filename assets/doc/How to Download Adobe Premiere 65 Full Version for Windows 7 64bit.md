## Step 1: Visit the Download Website
 
The first step is to visit the website that offers the Adobe Premiere 6.5 free download full version for Windows 7 64-bit. There are many websites that claim to provide this software, but not all of them are trustworthy or legitimate. Some of them may contain viruses, malware, or other harmful programs that can damage your computer or steal your personal information.
 
One of the websites that we recommend is [Softpedia](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Video/Video-Editors/Adobe-Premiere.shtml), which is a reputable online platform that provides software downloads and reviews. Softpedia has been around since 2001 and has millions of users worldwide. It also has a strict policy of testing and verifying all the software that it hosts on its servers.
